        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage. It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage-TEXT,IMAGE,HEADER,LIST</li>
          <li>Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers-META,CONTENT DIVISION,SEMANTIC.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, metadata.</li>
          <li>HTML Attributes defines additional info about an element.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for the webpage, important for SEO.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML doc.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML doc.</li>
          <li>the meta elements-charset,http-equiv,viewport. The viewport is the user's visible area of the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization</li>
          <li>This “parent/child” language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>Child elements are nested inside the parent element.</li>
          <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Semantic also plays an important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
          <li>Non-semantic elements-DIV,SPAN</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag</li>
          <li>A tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
          <li>Headings are larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page.</li>
          <li>The p element element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <li>List elements can be ordered, unordered, and list. </li>
          <li>The image element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage, it can hold various attributes.</li>

          <li> The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation. </li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content</li>
          <li>Each section element has an id attribute that also matches one of the four topics. HTML uses the id attribute as a way to identify elements and select them. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by devs to define how a webpage's content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, organization.</li>
          <li>The 3 ways to style a webpage are 1) inline css, 2) internal CSS style sheet, 3) external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>When using a external CSS, we link the file using link element placed in the HTML's head element. </li>
          <li>CSS rule is made up of Selector + Declarations that have 2 components 1) CSS property + 2) Value of the property.</li>
          <li>Selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations will apply.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is a box, CSS Box Model.</li>
          <li>DRY- Don't Repeat Yourself.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Block vs. Inline Box. Outer diplay and Inline Display.</li>
          <li>A link element creates the connection to an external file. rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location(URL) if the external resource using a relative path. </li>
          <li>The Class selector allows us to share a defined CSS rule an apply it to any element we choose by assigning that rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML.</li>
